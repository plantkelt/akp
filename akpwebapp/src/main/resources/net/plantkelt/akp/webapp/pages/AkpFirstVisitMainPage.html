		<h1>First visit</h1>
		<p>PlantKelt is a database of plant vernacular names in celtic
			languages.</p>
		<p>On this page, you can consult six example plant sheets. On each
			sheet, you will find a taxon name, with its synonyms and refining
			taxons, plus the vernacular names of this plant in various celtic
			languages. Each vernacular name is clearly associated to its
			bibliographical references.</p>
		<p>You can also search yourself through the corpus of linnaean
			names and botanical authors. The results are limited to 50 for each
			search in the linaean names and 25 in the botanical authors. Should
			your search be too wide, you will obtain too many results above the
			limit and the list will be incomplete.</p>
		<p>To obtain the whole of the data of PlantKelt, please subscribe,
			it's free! The database is updated and grows continuously.</p>
