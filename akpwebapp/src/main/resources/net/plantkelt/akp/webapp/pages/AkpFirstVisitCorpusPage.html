		<p>Introduction to the data corpus covered in PlantKelt.</p>
		<h2>Taxons to be found in PlantKelt</h2>
		<p>The taxon of PlantKelt are a group of plants which are found in
			the celtic countries, under various statuses. In this group, you can
			find:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>spontaneous plants such as the common oak;</li>
			<li>subspontaneous plants such as the chestnut tree&nbsp;;</li>
			<li>farmed plants such as the buckwheat;</li>
			<li>ornamental plants such as the plane tree;</li>
			<li>plants used in food such as coffee and cocoa;</li>
			<li>plants used in medicine preparations such as <i>Harpagophytum</i>&nbsp;;
			</li>
			<li>plants which appear only in literature such as the
				baobab&nbsp;;</li>
			<li>plants of lore such as oak mistletoe and celtic valerian;</li>
			<li>and even plants mistakenly identified such as <i>Hypochaeris
					maculata</i>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Linnaean spelling</h2>
		<p>
			These are the spelling rules set up by Linné, since then updated by
			the botanical community. The spelling rules do <b>not</b> respect the
			latin grammar.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the names of people to whom was dedicated a species or a
				taxon of lower rank end with 'ii' (ex: <i>Crataegus wilsonii</i>) or
				with 'i' when the person's name ends either with 'er' (ex: <i>Cicerbita
					plumieri</i>) or with a vowel (ex: <i>Catalpa bungei</i>);
			</li>
			<li>the abbreviation of "forma" is "fa.", according to the
				example of Kerguélen (Index synonymique de la Flore de France). The
				"f." abbreviation is used exclusively as the abbreviation of
				"filius";</li>
			<li>the dates of publications are indicated only if they help to
				discriminate between others. They are detailed in the IPNI
				(International Plant Names Index, Kew gardens, London) database;</li>
			<li>the reference works of publications are not mentioned. They
				can be found in details in the IPNI database;</li>
			<li>copying mistake: typos have been corrected (<i>Oenothera
					striata</i> / <i>stricta</i>) and spelling variations due to copying or
				printing mistakes are uniformedly marked "lapsus calami&nbsp;?" (<i>Malva
					parviflora</i> / <i>Malva passiflora</i>);
			</li>
			<li>spelling mistakes in diagnosis of authors respect the
				decisions of the botanists' community (<i>Abutilon megapomicum</i> /
				<i>megapotamicum</i> - <i>Glechoma hederacea</i> / <i>hederaceum</i>);
			</li>
			<li>Minor spelling variations found in reference works are
				marked "orth. var.";</li>
			<li>Comprehensive species are marked "aggr.".</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Abbreviations of authors' names</h2>
		<p>Some botanists have spent less time on the abbreviations of
			authors' names than on the linnaean names. Simply because botanists
			seldom use them when talking. In case of doubt, please refer to the
			IPNI database.</p>
		<p>However, one must take heed of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>homographs where the first name's initial may have been
				forgotten (A.Cunn., A.M.Cunn. R.Cunn.)&nbsp;;</li>
			<li>historical variations of abbreviations, which led to various
				spellings for one given author (Rchb., Reichb., Reichenb.,
				Reichenbach...)&nbsp;;</li>
			<li>names beginning with the same letters, which may have caused
				confusions (Hoffm., Hoffman, Hoffmans.)&nbsp;;</li>
			<li>close spellings, which may have caused typos: Walther,
				Walter.</li>
		</ul>
